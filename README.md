This was something that I’d documented when I was revising backend after a long break. I’d realized that I never really took a note of what I was learning, then I also realized that it would be the same with most of us out there - which is when I decided to make this public. There are way too many resources out there and the truth is, each one of them is right. It’s about what style of learning you’re comfortable with. This guide is for anyone who’s looking to dive into backend development using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB and covers almost every topic that is required for you to master it.
